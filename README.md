### Hi,
I'm jr-devel, welcome to my repository, I actually hope it would be interesting for you.

## My Time
I was a kid when the computing world arrived to me, and now I like all of it, I am a good programmer and tomorrow I will be a good Ethical Hacker. I have so many projects to do, and so many things to make it better

### Hope you enjoy this repo.
